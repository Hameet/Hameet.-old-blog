        <h2>What's your take on the EDA experience?</h2>
        <p>
          To put it bluntly It's going to be a lot of hard work and will require a lot of self education.
       </p>
       <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
       <p>
         So far I think the lack of technical knowledge will not be a hurdle.
       </p>
       <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
       <p>
         I'm used to working in a team and helping people out so I think I'll be fine.
       </p>
       <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>
       <p>
         They haven't changed much but I wonder if there'll be enough support provided.
       </p>
       <h5>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h5>
       <p>
         Yes, I am excited to an extent. I'm nervous about my capacity to retain what I will learn but time will tell.
