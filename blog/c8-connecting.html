          <h2>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h2>

            <p>Not too long ago, someone who had recently started working with our Quality Control team sent an email implying that since I had not ordered some consumables for the labortory  in due time they had to delay testing. </p>
           
            <p>Being the senior most technician in my team I have a lot of responsibilities along with training new staff. I replied back to this particular newbie and told her that the consumables required are prioritiesed as per product release. Instead of blaming me indirectly she should've consulted with me either in person or via email before planning a test and then finding out that they don't have the materials required.</p> 
           
            <p>The team member was probably trying to look good and efficient but instead got told off by the manager for not consulting with me first and not being a team player.</p>
