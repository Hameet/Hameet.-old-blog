            <h2>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h2>

              <p>I tried to write the code entirely by myself the first time and it took a while. This was probably the hardest part of the learning process for me as I realized that even something as simple as text alignment required a lot of googling. Overall I think I kept my focus on the process and didnâ€™t spend too much time redesigning the pages.</p>

            <h2>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h2>
              
              <p>Growing up in India in a traditional Sikh family I was quit familiar with it but never actually meditated on anything. I'm somewhat spiritual so I've done a fair bit of research on it.</p>
              
            <h2>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h2>

              <p>Apart from it's history dating back a few millennia I've learned that like most other crafts it's a skill which can be learned and then refined by regular practice. I particularly liked the bicycle analogy about micro recoveries to retain your balance.</p>
              
            <h2>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h2>

              <p>One that stood out was treating it like lifting weights. I suppose you could increase your attention span just like your bicep size if you remain consistent.</p>
              
            <h2>Any other musings</h2>
              
              <p>The statement that "The defualt state of the mind is Happiness". I think it's true to some extent that a calm and clear mind is happy. Personally I think that a calm and clear mind is content with itself and its surroundings.</p>
