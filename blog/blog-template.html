      <p> The Kailash mountain in the Tibetean Himalayas stands at 6,638m and is considered to be the source of some of the longest Asian rivers. The mountain is considered holy by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. I don't why I chose it for this blog, perhaps because I've always wanted to seet it. Learning web development is somewhat like conquering a mountain. I've got my own Kailash to climb it seems.</p>
