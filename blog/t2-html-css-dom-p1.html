          <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>
          
          <p>In terms of design, html is the structure, css would be the what you use to refine the structure and the DOM would be the best way to organise the structure.</p>

          <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
        
          <p>It basically means that everything you see in a webpage is contained within a box regardless whether its text or an image of any shape.</p>
        
          <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
        
          <p>From what I've learned until now a box model means that all elements in html are contained within a rectangular box.</p>
