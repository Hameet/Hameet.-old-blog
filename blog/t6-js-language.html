            <h2>In the JavaScript language, describe all the use cases for each of:</h2>

              <p>(): These are used to call a function. A function would be unable to work without them. Also later on if you want to add a parameter or an argument to the function you can include it inside the parenthesis.</p> 
 
              <p>[]: Their function is to include data either in the form of an array or an object. It's similar to creating a list in normal language. Brackets ([]) are typically mostly used for accessing the properties of an Object (or the elements of an Array), so mylist[3] fetches the fourth element in the Array.</p>
            
              <p>Braces {} are used during the declaration of Object Literals, or to enclose blocks of code (function definitions, conditional blocks, loops, etc). The code which defines a function is included in curly brackets.</p>
              
              <p>' ': Single quotes are used to contain function names and parameters and even arguments.</p>
              
              <p>"": These are used to contain a string (which could be a word or a sentence). Just like their use in written language, quotes are used to distinguish a certain part of the text. In coding text contained in quotes has a specific purpose.</p>
