            <h2>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h2>
               <p> From what I've understood mindfulness is self awareness at a broader scale. Self awareness teaches you to be conscious of your emotions and see yourself from  a third person perspective. Mind fullness teaches you that as well as controlling you ego and increasing your self confidence through the methods of self awareness.</p> 
                
                
            <h2>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h2>
                         
                <p>I think that was my favorite part of the chapter. The principle behind it is that we shouldn't let our emotions define who we are and should only see them as a physical/mental reaction of our mind and body.</p> 
                
            <h2>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it?       How did you feel?</h2>
                      
                <p>I did the journal exercise and wrote a few notes about things that annoy me and my weaknesses. I found out that writing might itself be one of my weaknesses. I can usually express what I feel in writing, it's just that when it's specifically required for something that I have to concentrate a bit more.</p>
