          <h2>What is a responsive site and why is it important?</h2>

          <p> A responsive site basically adjusts its content with the type of device of size of display screen being used. Whether
            you view the site on a computer (large screen) or on a mobile (small screen) it retains all of its content and
            features.</p>

          <h2>What is mobile first design and why is it important?</h2>

          <p>Mobile first design involves designing the website by giving priority to the mobile user. If the site works well
            on the mobile, it is likely to work better on other devices such as tablets and PCs. It is important as more
            and more people these days access the web on their cell phones.</p>

          <h2>What are frameworks?</h2>

          <p>A framework is basically the supporting structure for a webpage. It already has the basic content required to set
            up a website. Pros: You can just start building your webpage straight away and don’t have to write every little
            bit of code from scratch. Also features which might be too complicated for a beginner can be easily incorporated
            and used. Cons: There’s isn’t enough room for modification when using a framework and you might find that sometimes
            you’re unable to make even small changes. Everything has to be within the confines of the framework.</p>

          <h2>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</h2>

          <p>A wireframe is akin to a blueprint. You draw a very basic design of whatever website you want and use it as a blueprint
            when you begin the actual development process. 1 aspect of my wireframe which I found hard to implement was positioning
            the content image and the background image.</p>
