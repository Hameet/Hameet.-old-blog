            <h2>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h2>

              <p>I actually didn't do it as there was no one to do it with. However, when I was at Dev Academy for a "Day in the life of Dev Academy" I did a little bit of mindfulness conversation with another prospective student and we both found it a bit awkward but at the same time a good method to reveal a person's viewpoint on certain things.</p>

                         
            <h2>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h2>

             <p>I normally mediate or at least try to do it as it helps me sleep. I find the breathing technique the easiest and also the most sensible.</p>
