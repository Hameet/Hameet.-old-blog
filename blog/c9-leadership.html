          <h2>What is your experience of compassionate leadership?</h2>

            <p>While working at my previous job in Auckland I needed to go to back to India to visit my family for several weeks. Even though I was reletavily new and didn't have enough leave accrued my Team Leader let me go as I explained to her it was a family emergency.</p>

          <h2>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h2>
           
            <p>> Status: From what I've learned during Phase 0 I would say I've gained some status when it comes to learn the basics of programming. Although it's going to take considerable amount of work to keep that status.</p> 
           
            <p>> Certainty: Have hit more than a few bumps but am still certain that this is the path I want to take.</p>

            <p>> Autonomy: I do like to do things my way if I can. During Phase 0 I did ask for help with a few things but most issues I solved my self. I like to give my hundred percent and then ask for help.</p>

            <p>> Fairness: No issues here at all. Everything seems fair and good.</p>

            <p>> Relatedness: In terms of the perception of whether another person is a "freind" or a "foe". All the people I've been in contact with have been very freindly and patient with my lack of knowledge.</p>
