    <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
    <p>
      There were a lot of concepts in Chapter 1. The one's that appeal the most to me were how the body responds to emotional changes and how visible they can be. You have to train yourself in a way that you can sort of see yourself from the outside, pretty much from a third person point of view. Oh and there are people who are Happiness strategiests? That sounds like a fun job.

    <h2>How did you find the 2 minutes of mindfullness?</h2>
    <p>
      It's an interesting concept but I personally find meditation quite hard as my mind wanders a lot.
