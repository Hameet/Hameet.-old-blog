        <h2> When I got blocked on a simple problem? </h2>
        
        <p> What was the problem: I couldn't figure out how to link my blogs to the index page. After a while I gave up but then got back on it and noticed the missing part of the code instantly and the problem was sorted.</p>

        <p>What problem solving techniques did you use?: I took small breaks so that I wouldn't get frustrated trying to find the solution.</p>

        <p>How did you feel throughout the process?: Anger, frustration at first and releif in the end.</p>

        <p>What did you learn?: That rushing will not get you anywhere and your mind needs to reset itself.</p>

        <h2>When I solved a problem in an elegant way?</h2>

        <p>Not sure if it can be called elegant but I definitely did a lot of googling for some of the javascript questions. In the end I solved the question from what I had learned by googling similar problems. It was very cathartic when I found the solution to a compicated problem myself.</p>
