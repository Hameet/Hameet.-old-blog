        <h2>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h2>
        <p>For starters I would saw it's much harder in terms of understanding and its implication. If HTML is the structure and CSS the decoration of a house, then javascript is both the building material and method. The more complex the structure the more work is required to construct it.</p>

        <h2>Explain control flow and loops using and example from everyday life?</h2>
        <p>Control flow is akin to a how a car engine works, you execute a certain step first to get to the next one. For e.g you have to put the transmission in a lower gear first, you can't just jump into a higer gear. Loops as the name suggests execute a section of code a number of times. A real life example would be manually calculating the product of a number with other numbers e.g a table of 2 or 3, a loop in javascript can be set up to perform such a mathematical function.</p>

        <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects?</h2>
        <p>Both are used to store data in the form of indexes and elements. Basically to access data from an Array the code specifies the position of the piece of data required whereas to access data from an Object you need to specify the type of data as well it's location in structure.</p>

        <h2>What are functions and why are they useful?</h2>
          <p>Functions are just like mathematical formulas and can perform a variety of different tasks depending on the user's requirments.</p>
