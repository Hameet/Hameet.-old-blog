          <h2>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h2>
            <p>For me personally, I would prefer a type of happiness which is easily sustainable. Although, all 3 are part of a normal person's life. I'm always trying to find a purpose to what I do and would like to be part of something bigger than myself, something meaningful.</p>

          <h2>What are your core values?</h2>
            <p>My core values would be honesty (in it's widest sense), kindness. I am a man of my word. I would say thay I'm quit traditional and old fashioned.</p>

          <h2>What do you stand for?</h2>
            <p>I stand for basic human rights, fairness, freedom of speech.</p>
