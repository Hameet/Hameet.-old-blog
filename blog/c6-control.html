          <h2>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h2>
        
            <p>I'm usually very calm and laid back so it takes a lot to trigger me. While coding if I keep looking at something for too long trying to fix it I get frustrated and need to walk away. I don't think my emotional or physical response to stress caused during coding fits the book's definition of Triggers. In fact I'm even chiller than Gandhi.</p> 


          <h2>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h2>
            <p>I found it easy enough to follow. I found the "Response strategy" period interesting.</p>
